### In the ever-evolving landscape of cyber threats, some cases remain shrouded in mystery long after their discovery. This talk revisits an enigmatic cyberespionage platform uncovered decade ago - one that still raises questions about its origins, targets, and intent. This talk will explore the intriguing details of this case, shredding light on its signifiance in the history of advanced persistent threats (APTs).

### An exciting adventure of a red-teaming engagement with a tiny attack surface led us to hacking a Quake World server. We dove into old school Quake’s code, uncovered vulnerabilities, and used them to achieve our goals. This fun and beginner-friendly talk is packed with unexpected twists, frags and plenty of laughs, all leading to the ultimate win: gaining a shell!
<br>

### For years Mateusz has been professionally involved in IT security. He is a member of the LogicalTrust.net team, where he conducts penetration tests and security research. He has participated in security analyses of several hundred mobile and web applications. He has presented at many events. He has found bugs in software such as Quake, PHP, Apache, Microsoft, OpenSSH, FreeBSD, NetBSD, and others. He has contributed bits to Open Source projects, including PHP and NetBSD.

## <b>Ransomware-cybercriminals in the darknet - a live visit (Closing Keynote)</b>

### Tobias Schrödel

### In this talk, we shed some light on the dark side of the web. We will visit the darknet live and take a deeper look on some name & shame pages of ransomware gangs. We will understand, how the darknet works and how we find the pages of cybercriminals. There we see, which company is under attack right now. How does the blackmailing work? How much is the ransom? How are the cybercriminals organized in detail? And what does it really mean, when you don't pay and your stolen data is in the web.

### Tobias Schroedel is "Germany's first IT comedian" - as the German CHIP magazine once wrote. And indeed, he explains technical system gaps and interrelationships in a way that everyone can understand, while not missing out on the fun. His Wikipedia entry with further information can be found [here](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobias_Schr%C3%B6del).

### Penetration testing isn’t just about finding vulnerabilities—it’s about understanding your systems, improving resilience, and recognizing patterns in security failures. Drawing from over 200 professional pentests, this session explores key lessons learned, including:

- ### Common misconceptions between penetration testing, audits, and red teaming.
- ### The top vulnerabilities (e.g., CWE-200, CWE-79) and their real-world implications.
- ### Best practices for conducting effective pentests, from planning to reporting.
- ### Technical insights: examples of misconfigured headers, cache issues, and SQL injection.

### This talk combines technical depth and practical advice, ideal for security professionals, developers, and IT managers aiming to strengthen their cybersecurity strategies.

### Hi, I’m Adam, and:

- ### I play CTFs because it’s fun!
- ### I founded the 17 53c Association (and Foundation!) because I could!
- ### I work at LogicalTrust because I want to—and I love talking about cybersecurity.
- ### In my free time, I try to break some apps—just for fun!

### For years, I’ve been fascinated by the evolution of cybersecurity. What started as a keen interest in IT security has developed into a dedicated pursuit of knowledge and skill refinement in this field. Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions offer me the chance to apply my expertise in practical scenarios, improve my skills, and exchange ideas with fellow professionals.

## <b>Taking Over Accounts with a Little Help from Microsoft SSO</b>

### Marek Geleta

### Using the "Log in with Microsoft" SSO from either a user or vendor perspective might seem secure, but it’s far from foolproof. While exploring open-source OAuth libraries, I discovered and enhanced methods that enable complete account takeovers by exploiting unverified email claims. Although Microsoft initially addressed some of these issues, they refused to take action when workarounds were found. In this talk, I’ll explain how these exploits work, why the patches were insufficient, what this means for users and vendors relying on MS SSO, and how they can protect themselves.
<br>
### Marek Geleta is a cybersecurity enthusiast with a passion for web security and CTF competitions. He is the captain of the Slovak Cyber Team, actively leading the country’s top CTF talent in international competitions. Since 2017, he has discovered critical vulnerabilities for companies like Microsoft, Atlassian, and Xiaomi. In 2024, he won the student category of Slovakia’s CyberGame. Currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Cybersecurity at MUNI, Marek is dedicated to uncovering vulnerabilities and advancing the field of web security.
