### Using the "Log in with Microsoft" SSO from either a user or vendor perspective might seem secure, but it’s far from foolproof. While exploring open-source OAuth libraries, I discovered and enhanced methods that enable complete account takeovers by exploiting unverified email claims. Although Microsoft initially addressed some of these issues, they refused to take action when workarounds were found. In this talk, I’ll explain how these exploits work, why the patches were insufficient, what this means for users and vendors relying on MS SSO, and how they can protect themselves.

### In this talk, we shed some light on the dark side of the web. We will visit the darknet live and take a deeper look on some name & shame pages of ransomware gangs. We will understand, how the darknet works and how we find the pages of cybercriminals. There we see, which company is under attack right now. How does the blackmailing work? How much is the ransom? How are the cybercriminals organized in detail? And what does it really mean, when you don't pay and your stolen data is in the web.
