title: "Code of Conduct"
---

TLDR: Simply put, "Do not be an ass or we will kick your ass out!" The BSidesBA staff reserves the right to determine what constitutes "being an ass". We have ZERO TOLERANCE for harassment of any kind, be it physical, verbal, or sexual.

The BSidesBA is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone; regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, nationality, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference staff, volunteers, presenters, attendees, and participants in any form. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference, **without a refund**, at the discretion of the conference organizers.

This Code of Conduct applies during the entire conference and in any conference associate space, online or otherwise. Which includes, but is not limited to: the conference venue, presentation spaces, evening gatherings and chat channels or social media.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, nationality, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording without permission, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate at this conference. Speakers and chat participants should not use sexualized images, language, or other material.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the conference staff immediately. For any harassment that happens after the conference, staff members can be reached year-round by emailing coc@bsidesba.sk.

This Code of Conduct is based on the template found here [https://seagl.org/code_of_conduct.html](https://seagl.org/code_of_conduct.html) and [BSides Las Vegas](https://bsideslv.org/coc)
